# GPT-Neo Chatbot
## GPT-Neo
GPT-Neo is an open-source language processing model, created by EleutherAI, that uses deep learning to generate human-like text. It stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer-Neo" and is an improved version of OpenAI's GPT-2 model. GPT-Neo has been trained on a massive amount of data and can generate coherent and realistic text on a wide range of topics, making it a powerful tool for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation. Its architecture is based on the transformer neural network model and it can be fine-tuned on specific tasks using transfer learning techniques. Since it is open-source, developers can easily build and customize their own models based on GPT-Neo, making it a highly versatile and accessible tool for natural language processing.
## Code description 
This is the main code file of a Flask application. It imports necessary packages including `torch`, `transformers`, `flask`, `atexit`, `zmq`, and `socket`.

The code sets up the environment and loads the GPT-Neo model using the `GPT2Tokenizer` and `GPTNeoForCausalLM` classes from the transformers package. The model is loaded with the pre-trained weights from the `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B` checkpoint.

It also defines the Flask application with the root route `@app.route('/')`, which returns the `index.html` file using the `render_template` function.

The `/qa` route uses the `POST` method to receive a user's question and return an answer generated by the GPT-Neo model. The get_answer function is responsible for generating an answer for the input question using the GPT-Neo model.

The function `stop_server` uses the`zmq package` to listen for a stop signal to gracefully shutdown the Flask app.

Finally, the stop_thread is started as a background thread to listen for the stop signal. The Flask app is run on port `5000` with debug mode enabled.
## HTML template
This file is under templates/pages. The template contains a form with a text input field for users to enter their questions, and a submit button to send the question to the server. The form's action attribute is set to "/qa", indicating that the form data should be submitted to the server's "/qa" route. The template also includes a conditional statement to display the answer returned by the server if it exists. If the answer variable is not null, a paragraph element will be created with the answer text. The template's title, header, and labels provide clear instructions and guidance to the user on how to use the chatbot.
## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Run the Flask app:
```
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ flask run
```
Or
```
$ python app.py
```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to see the chatbot interface.
3. Enter your question and click the "Ask" button to get an answer.
